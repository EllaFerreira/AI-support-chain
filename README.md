# AI-Support-Chain ü§ñ ‚õìÔ∏è

AI-Support-Chain is a tool that spots recurring issues in user queries. It uses AI to detect patterns in support requests and prioritize frequent problems, making it easier to manage and resolve common issues.

## Architecture

The project is a monorepo using Nx, a powerful toolkit for building modern web applications. The project is structured into multiple applications and libraries, making it highly scalable and maintainable.

### Key Components

* **api:** The core API application, built with NestJS, responsible for processing support requests, identifying patterns, and providing insights.
* **web:** A web application built with Angular, allowing users to interact with the AI-Support-Chain platform and view generated insights.
* **shared:** A library containing shared components and utilities used across different applications.
* **data:** A library for interacting with data storage, potentially using databases or other persistence mechanisms.
